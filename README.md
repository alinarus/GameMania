SOA patterns

* API Gateway â€“ Game Mania App acts as an api gateway of the system, redirecting client calls to the microservices that are responsible for them.
* Database per service - Each microservice that requires a database has one, even if in this case only the play later App does.
* Service instance per container - Each service instance is deployed in a separate docker container.
